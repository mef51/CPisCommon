I'm grateful to the referee for the helpful recommendations and comments.

3. Changed to conform to the IAU standard

4. The SMA observes point sources over a large range of parallactic angles to correct for it and to obtain the polarization leakages, however Stokes I and V are independent of the leakages to first-order. Added a paragraph at the end of section 2.1 to explain this. As an aside the SMA only uses QWPs and has no half-wave plates.

5. Added a clarification after eq. 2 to highlight that I(l,m) is convolved with the instrumenal beam. Miriad produces only a single beam for all polarizations. I checked that the instrumental beams for the LL and RR polarizations were not very different from each other by 'forcing' Miriad to invert each set of data seperately. The beams had very slight differences in their RMS but the shape of both beams were essentially identical. The penultimate paragraph before section 4 explains this.

6. replaced the offending line with your suggestion.
