0. most figure labels are larger

1. Added a little explanation of GK in the intro

2. While there seem to be several VLA and VLBA observations of CP I believe the most relevant work is that by Cotton etal. 2011 using the VLBA. The VLBA is equipped with off-axis circular feeds and they used a very similar squint correction as the one we detail. I added a paragraph to the ends of Section 2 and Section 5.1 to highlight this. Other relevant observations (like Hezareh etal. 2013) used linear feeds.

3. Changed to conform to the IAU standard

4. The SMA observes point sources over a large range of parallactic angles to correct for it and to obtain the polarization leakages, however Stokes I and V are independent of the leakages to first-order. Added a paragraph at the end of section 2.1 to explain this. As an aside the SMA only uses QWPs and has no half-wave plates.

5. Added a clarification after eq. 2 to highlight that I(l,m) is convolved with the instrumenal beam. In regards to the deconvolution Miriad produces only a single beam for all polarizations. I checked that the instrumental beams for the LL and RR polarizations were not very different from each other by 'forcing' Miriad to invert each set of data seperately. The beams had very slight differences in their RMS but the shape of both beams were essentially identical. The penultimate paragraph before section 4 now explains this.

6. replaced the offending line concerning the SMA feeds with your suggestion.

7. purple --> blue in figures

8. The first paragraph of 5.2 now explains the physical basis for ARS

9. added acknowledgements section
